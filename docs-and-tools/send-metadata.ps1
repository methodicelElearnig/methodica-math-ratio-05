#Requires -Version 7.0
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Send the metadata/ folder (1 unit + 6 components + 19 items, methodica-math-ratio-05) to the Kata
    (Katalog) catalog API at https://kata.cet.ac.il/api/v1.

.DESCRIPTION
    Walks the metadata tree top-down and UPSERTS each entity (GET by uniqueKey ->
    PATCH if it exists, else POST). Transforms the on-disk metadata into the API
    payloads, filling in required fields the metadata lacks (from the CONFIG block
    below) and remapping values that fall outside the API enums.

    Runtime: PowerShell 7+ and curl.exe (bundled with Windows 10/11).

    SAFETY: never hard-code the API key here — this script is committed. Supply it via
    -ApiKey, $env:KATA_API_KEY, or the git-ignored kata-api-key.txt next to this script
    (see SEND-METADATA.md). The script refuses to run without one and never logs it.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Build and print every payload WITHOUT any network call. No key required.

.PARAMETER ApiKey
    The Kata API key. Overrides $env:KATA_API_KEY and kata-api-key.txt.

.PARAMETER BaseUrl
    Override the API base URL (default https://kata.cet.ac.il).

.PARAMETER MetadataDir
    Override the metadata folder (default: the metadata/ folder next to this script).

    pwsh -File send-metadata.ps1 -DryRun

#  REUSE GUIDE — running this for a DIFFERENT unit? Touch only what applies:
#    (1) ALWAYS: set the API key, and point $MetadataDir at the unit's folder.
#    (2) PER-UNIT: usually fine as-is (title language, manufacture, overrides).
#    (3) CONTENT VOCABULARY: adjust ONLY for a different subject or new metadata
#        values — the cognitiveLevel codes (subject-specific!) and the small
#        value-mapping tables. If the metadata contains a value not covered here,
#        the script STOPS with a clear message naming it, so you know what to add.
#    (4) 720 STANDARD ENUMS: rarely change — they mirror the KATA spec.
#  Sections are ordered (1)->(4) below.

# Where the CONTENT is served from, for hostedContentRef — the field Kata launches the

#
# ⚠️ DELIBERATELY NOT DERIVED FROM $Comp.id. Until 2026-09-16 this script built the ref as
#   ($Comp.id.TrimEnd('/')) + '/index.html'
# and an id lives under 720active/ while the content is served from 720/. The split is
# correct by design — 720 v2.5 p.11 says an id "אינו חייב להוביל בפועל לדף אינטרנט פעיל",
# and no clause ties an id to a serving URL — so deriving one from the other produced a
# launch URL that serves 0 bytes. Kata currently holds the correct 720/ values, which means
# the next live run of this script would have overwritten a working launch path with a dead
# one, for every component of this unit.
#
# Take this from the unit's own DEPLOY.md deploy target. No trailing slash.

$TitleLangKey = 'Hebrew'
# ⚠️ NO LONGER SENT (2026-09-09). v2.5 §2.6 renamed the v2.4 component field
# `manufacture` to the unit field `manufacturer` and retyped it as the ministry's
# supplier number. It is moot either way, because KATA derives the value itself
# from the group owning the API key and returns the provider's DISPLAY NAME:
# mass-measure-02's unit metadata carries no manufacturer at all, yet the
# catalogue reports "מתודיקה". Sending anything here is therefore either ignored
# or a chance to be wrong, so New-UnitBody omits the field. Kept only to document
# why. (This unit's metadata does carry manufacturer = "310"; §2.6 asks for a
# number while the standard's own API examples still show a string — unresolved,
# and not worth guessing at when the server overwrites it.)

#
# Since metadata v2.3 the metadata files store the SAME kebab-case vocabulary the
# API uses, so these maps are only needed for legacy values left over from the
# pre-v2.3 files. Everything else passes through and is checked against the

# 3c. cognitiveLevel: metadata value -> official MOE code — SUBJECT-SPECIFIC.
#     KATA validates against GET /api/v1/cognitive-levels. The codes turned out to
#     be kebab-case slugs identical to what the metadata stores, so this map only
#     translates the pre-v2.3 Title Case labels; a different subject (e.g. math)

# THIS UNIT IS MATHEMATICS, so the four `mathematics` codes are the relevant ones; the
# science codes are kept because the endpoint accepts them and a shared unit could use them.
#
# ⚠️ VOCABULARY MISMATCH — the metadata/ files in this repo currently carry word-reversed
#    spellings that the API will reject with 422 "code does not exist", e.g.
#        metadata says            KATA/720 vocabulary
#        thinking-algorithmic  -> algorithmic-thinking
#        content-interactive   -> interactive-content

#        exercise-solved       -> solved-exercise
#        task-inquiry-or-project  -> project-or-inquiry-task
#    The lists here deliberately hold the LIVE vocabulary rather than the metadata's, so that
#    `send-metadata.ps1 -DryRun` names every offending value instead of failing later against
#    the real API. Confirm the canonical spelling with CET, fix metadata/, then push.
