   xapi-720-k.js gates an item's 'completed' on xapiItemAnswered[itemId], a map it fills ONLY
   from an 'answered' passing through in the SAME page load:

       if (sttmContext?.expectsAnswer && !xapiItemAnswered[_cid]) {
           console.log("[XAPI] item left unanswered — deferring 'completed': " + _cid);
           return;          // "deferring" is a DROP — there is no queue, flush or retry

   That guard is right within a session: it stops a learner who leaves a question backwards
   through goBack() from emitting a resultless 'completed' that would then block the real,
   scored one. But a resume deliberately does NOT re-send the answers it restores, so without
   the seeding below the library treats every previously answered item as unanswered and drops
   its 'completed' — while sendStatementOnce, having called the sender, marks the ledger sent.
   The lomda then never asks again, the library never retries, and the statement is lost for
   good. Verified live against Kata on 07.09.26: the ledger said sent while the library's own
   xapiCompletedObjects was still empty.

   Seeding puts the library back where it would have been had the learner never left. It emits
   nothing itself — it only unblocks the guard, and the 'completed' that follows carries the
   explicit result xapiItemResult() supplies, so nothing rides on the library's own scoring.

   Only items with a RECORDED ANSWER are seeded, so an item the learner never answered is still
   deferred and the goBack protection above is preserved.

   Opening alone is not enough. Each overlay closes three ways (its close button, a click on the

   twice reported 'requested.1' twice. The check lives here rather than at the call sites because

   ── Scope: the whole unit attempt ──
   XAPI_HINTS_SENT alone is cleared on reload, which used to mean a learner who refreshed and
   reopened the same hint reported 'requested.1' a second time. Every cross-part 'חזרה' is also a
   fresh page load, so this happened in normal use and not only on a manual refresh. The keys now
   live in the state document too, under `hints`, through the same sendStatementOnce the
   'completed' ledger uses — so they survive a reload, a cross-part hop and a tab close.
   XAPI_HINTS_SENT stays in front of it as the in-memory fast path, so a repeat click costs no
   document read.

   Two orderings matter:
   - The memory latch is set only when sendStatementOnce reports the key SETTLED. While a restore
     is in flight it returns false and sends nothing, so latching there would swallow the

/* played/paused for HTML5 <video> — CONTENT VIDEO ONLY, by explicit opt-in.
   ── Why an allowlist rather than every <video> ──
   The previous version selected querySelectorAll('video') with no filter, and in the reference
   unit that caught a decorative autoplay/loop/muted clip of the companion character — not
   content — which was wired and reporting.

   ⚠️ This stopped being hypothetical here on 03.09.26: component 01's screen 0 now carries TWO
   such clips, the character-selection cards (`assets/video/character-*-selection.mp4`,
   autoplay/loop/muted/playsinline). Neither carries data-xapi-report, so the allowlist keeps
   them silent — which is the whole point of it. An unfiltered querySelectorAll('video') would
   now be actively reporting decoration.
   It was not quiet reporting either: an element that is playing emits a pause event followed by a
   play whenever .load() or a src swap happens, i.e. a fabricated paused/played pair on every
   entry to the screen, including on back-navigation and on resume.
   Only elements carrying data-xapi-report are wired now, its value being the item suffix (e.g.
   data-xapi-report="003"). No element in this unit carries it, so video
   reporting is off in practice — the mechanism stays ready for real content video.
   ── objectId: the ITEM, not the question (15.09.26) ──
   Reported by the test team: these statements went out against the PART. Carrying xapiQ() was
   never enough. The library builds object.id from sttmContext.objectId, else from a questionId
   but ONLY for answered/selected/requested, else from window.METADATA.id. played/paused are in
   neither allowlist, so the questionId and parentId were discarded and the component id was sent
   (xapi-720-k.js, the object block). They now pass objectId: xapiItemId(item) — the same helper
   that anchors item initialized/completed.
   xapiQ() and data-xapi-q are gone from this path: the object is the ITEM, and a video item need
   not carry a question at all (mass-measure-01's item 006 has none).
   ⚠️ MOE's own "דוגמאות XAPI" §6/§7 show a COMPONENT id in object for Played/Paused. We follow
   the test team, because a component-level video event cannot say which video. Written
   confirmation from MOE is still open — ask it together with the same question for 'requested'. */
