   RESUME — save / restore execution state to KATA (xAPI State API)
   Shared by all six components. Definition-only; ../unit-js/90-boot.js calls
   initResumeResetHatch() and initResumeLeaveHandlers(), and ../unit-js/50-loader.js drives the
   restore itself. Full design: Documentation/reporting-and-resume/ADDING-REPORTING-AND-RESUME.md §8.

   ── One document per {learner, component} — Kata's model, and since v6 ours ──
   Verified against Documentation/KATA/KATA-API.md and Kata's own note (2026-09-16): the
   registration our content saves State under is a {user, component} pair — for one learner every
   component of the unit has a DIFFERENT registration, hence a different document. The address is
   ?registration ALONE (or studentId+componentKey; sending both is a 400). The platform launches
   each component on its own (POST /launcher/context takes one componentId and returns one
   registrationId), and since 2026-09-16 no part navigates to another or copies its query along —
   so every part reads and writes ITS OWN document, nothing else.

   v6 (2026-09-16): the document itself now matches. No more `part` (landing pointer), `prev`
   (back edges) or `parts{}` (every part's payload) — instead `component` (whose document this is)
   and `payload` (this part's). A document whose `component` is not the current part is
   discarded with console.warn: one registration shared by two components would be a platform-side
   fault, and another part's payload is never applied.

   The platform may CLEAR one component's State on a repeat entry (a re-take of an assessment
   component). An absent document (404) is therefore "a fresh attempt": no payload, empty ledgers
   (the completed goes out again — intended), and an empty `results` section that beats the
   localStorage cache of the previous attempt (read precedence in the getters).

   (window.XAPI_UNIT_ID and RESUME_STATE_ID only dictate the localStorage fallback key, which
   comes into play when there is no valid ?slxapi. RESUME_STATE_ID carries the part slug so that
   fallback is one document per part as well — without it a ?dev=1 walk from 01 to 02 read 01's
   document in 02.)

   ── Three facts from that document that bear directly on the code here ──
   • Durability: Kata "never acknowledges a write that wasn't durably saved". The true returned by
     saveState720 is a real promise, which is what justifies the !== false check in
     persistUnitState.
   • Size: ~1MB ceiling (413 above it). This document is tiny — one part's payload and four
     ledgers — so there is no concern.
   • Retention: ~12 months from the last update, after which GET returns 404. readUnitState treats
     404/null as "new document", so a learner returning after longer simply starts fresh.

   Per-part seams, all read at CALL time:
     capturePartPayload()   returns this component's payload, including currentScreen
     applyResumeVars(st)    restores answer variables — parameter MUST be named `st`
     applyResumeDom(st)     restores values that live only in the DOM
     restoreScreenUI(n)     repaints an answered screen; MUST stay exception-safe
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/* v4 (2026-09-01): added `ui` (the chosen character) and `results`. Until v3 the character lived
   ONLY in localStorage, so a learner continuing the same registration from another machine got the
   wrong avatar. The document is the source of truth and localStorage a synchronous cache.
   v5: the unit was re-cut from four components to the script's six, so a v4 document named parts
   over screen ranges that had moved; it was discarded.

   v6 (2026-09-16): one document per part — `component` + `payload` instead of
   `part`/`parts{}`/`prev{}` (see the header). There IS a migration from v5 (migrateState):
   payload = parts[this part's slug]; the four ledgers, the character and the results are kept as
   they are. Any other v is discarded. A learner mid-part on upload day loses nothing.

   ⚠️ Even so, every ?v= on unit-js/*.js and on script.js in all six index.html MUST be bumped in
   the same commit — a stale cached 40-resume.js reading a v6 document deletes it, and a new
   script.js against a stale 40-resume.js calls setters that do not exist. */

/* ── Unit-level state — character and cross-part results ─────────────
   ── Why there is a getter/setter layer at all ──
   Until v4 the character was read and written straight to localStorage in parts 01 and 05. That
   worked perfectly on one machine and broke completely on two: the Kata document did not carry
   it, so a learner continuing the same registration elsewhere got the wrong avatar. This layer
   moves the authority to the document.

   ── Read precedence, and why ──
   1. The document, if `ui`/`results` EXIST on it. Existence, not value: a reset document holds
      {character:null} and {}, and that must beat a stale cache — otherwise ?resetState is not a
      reset.
   2. localStorage, when there is no document at all — i.e. before resume has read (the
      synchronous path at the top of each script.js) or when resume is off entirely.

   ── And why localStorage is still written ──
   It became a synchronously readable cache rather than a source of truth. That is what holds the
   no-flash rule: window.lomdaState.selectedCharacter is set at the top of each script.js, before
   the first paint, while the document is still two CDN scripts away. */

   3. The mark is persisted SYNCHRONOUSLY right here. Some callers send without navigating
      afterwards, so nothing else would ever write it.

   'initialized' is never suppressed — the platform asks for it on every entry.

   sendStatementOnce carries these invariants for ANY verb; sendCompletedOnce is the 'completed'

   ── Why this exists ──
   Part 03 is reachable from TWO places: from part 02 (the normal route) and from part 01 directly
   (when the learner clears the 4/5 threshold and skips part 02). A hard-coded back button would
   send the skipper into content they never saw.

   The solution is a MAP OF EDGES, not a stack: forward navigation writes the edge, back
   navigation only reads it. There is no invariant a partial write can break.

   ── One layer + a fallback (all of it DEV_NAV-only since 2026-09-16) ──
   1. The edge map in sessionStorage — available SYNCHRONOUSLY from the moment the script loads.
   2. The hard-coded arguments — for when storage is blocked or no edge exists.
   The document tier (`prev`) went with the landing pointer in v6: the document belongs to one
   part and has nothing to point at. The navigation itself runs only under DEV_NAV
   (10-identity.js); in production the platform launches each component on its own.

   The edge also carries the target screen's hash, because the screen to return to differs by
   source.

   sessionStorage rather than localStorage: the edge belongs to the current attempt. An
   edge left over from a previous attempt could route a learner down a path they did not take.

   Off-platform there is no ?registration, so the library's localStorage fallback keys every local
   run to the SAME document — after one pass the ledger is full and no 'completed' is ever emitted
   again, which reads as a catastrophic regression to whoever tests next. ?resetState starts from
   a clean slate.

   It strips itself from the URL: left in place it would re-fire on every reload and resume
   would never work. The strip
   must happen before anything reads the query, which is why 90-boot.js calls this FIRST; the
   _resetRequested flag carries the intent through to readUnitState, which runs later once the URL
   is already clean.

   It clears the cache too, not only the document. The getters fall back to localStorage when
   there is no document — i.e. exactly on the synchronous path at the top of each script.js,
   before readUnitState. Without this, ?resetState would leave the previous run's character alive
   until the document arrived, and a reset that leaves state behind is not a reset. */
